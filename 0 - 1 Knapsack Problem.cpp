// You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
//  Note that we have only one quantity of each item.
// In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values and weights associated with N items respectively. 
// Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that 
// sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
